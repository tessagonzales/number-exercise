Here is a sample array of credit card numbers:
['4916-2600-1804-0530', '4779-252888-3972', '4252-278893-7978', '4556-4242-9283-2260'] 

In the sample array above, the digits add up to 49, 81, 81, and 64 respectively. Since there are two which have the same sum, the function should return the last one with that sum, in this case '4252-278893-7978'
